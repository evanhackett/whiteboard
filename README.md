# Collaborative Whiteboard

I wanted to try out [Croquet](https://www.croquet.io/), so I made a thing.

This is just a demo, not really that usable of an app. No eraser or undo for example.

## Sharing your whiteboard

To share your whiteboard with another user, copy/paste the full url including the query string.

Simply going to https://evanhackett.com/whiteboard will create a new session with a new whiteboard. For 2 users to be viewing the same whiteboard, their urls must have the same query string.
